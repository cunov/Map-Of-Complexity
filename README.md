# [Map-Of-Complexity](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ccunov#!/vizhome/Complexity_Researchers/Sheet1?publish=yes)

I scraped the 2000 most-cited researchers on Google Scholar that had Complex Systems, Complex Adaptive Systems, and/or Complexity as one of their interests on Google Scholar, as well as their top 5 co-authors. Might be useful for someone looking to find a place to study the field.

Limitations include: 
* complexity could mean [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory)
* researchers don't always enter their email or affiliation correctly, or have multiple and I may have misattributed their main one
* some are no longer active
* researchers may co-author a lot with someone who isn't active in the field
* this one misses out on the younger, less-published researchers which is a very important consideration when choosing a lab!
